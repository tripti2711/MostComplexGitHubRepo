# MostComplexGitHubRepo
#I am currently developing a Python-based tool that aims to identify the most technically complex and challenging repository from a GitHub user's profile. The tool functions by taking a GitHub user's URL as input and then utilizes the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and LangChain. The process involves assessing each repository individually to determine its technical complexity.

#The tool follows a unique approach inspired by how we interact with AI language models. First, I send the code in chunks to GPT, prompting it to keep track and memorize all the provided chunks. Once all chunks are processed, I send the last prompt, instructing GPT to read the entire code in those chunks. In response, GPT provides a complexity score as the first line of its response, followed by a detailed explanation of the reasons for its assessment in the second line.
